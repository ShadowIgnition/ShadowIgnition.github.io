<p>During my time at Lightmare, I played an active role in the development of the studio's flagship digital trading card games, Infinity Wars Classic and Infinity Heroes. I made substantial contributions to both games, focusing on various aspects of their design and implementation.</p>

<p>Here are some notable contributions that I made:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Led the design and development of a comprehensive node-based Single-Player Framework, which facilitated the creation of campaigns and tutorial levels. Furthermore, I created a series of tutorials for both games.</li>
  <li>Developed the "EffectNodeFinderTool," a tool that streamlined search processes and allowed for the automation of repetitive tasks.</li>
  <li>Revamped several aspects of the game's visuals, including the appearance of unowned "worn" cards, implemented improved foiling effects for cards, and enhanced presentation of the in-game environment through the use of materials, shaders, and lighting updates.</li>
  <li>Managed server-sided game settings and user accounts by client-server API communication.</li>
  <li>Provided feedback on art pieces and general art direction to artists, including in areas of card, item, and UI artwork. Notably, oversaw the art direction & design of the "Genesis" skin. Additionally, lead the development of a UI Skinning system to ensure consistency and coherence in the visual design of UI elements.</li>
  <li>Engaged extensively with the community through various channels, including Discord, Steam discussions, Patreon messages, and Support emails.</li>

</ul>

<p>Thanks to my significant contributions, my time at Lightmare had a great impact on both the quality of the game and reducing the workload for other developers. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience working there, which made it all the more fulfilling.</p>
